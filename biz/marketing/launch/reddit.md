# Reddit Launch Posts

## Target Subreddits

| Subreddit | Subscribers | Rules Summary | Post Style |
|-----------|------------|---------------|-----------|
| | | | |

## Post Template
<!-- Reddit hates self-promotion. Frame as: "I had this problem, so I built a thing" -->
<!-- Include: problem story, what you tried, what you built, what you learned -->
<!-- End with: "Would love feedback" not "Please sign up" -->

## Guidelines
- Read each subreddit's rules before posting
- Be an active member first, poster second
- Never post the same thing to multiple subreddits simultaneously
- Respond to every comment thoughtfully
- Upvote ratio below 60% = wrong subreddit or wrong framing
