## Growth Model

### Wow Factor vs Recurring Value

These are **separate things**. Diagnose each independently.

- **Wow Factor**: The first impression that makes users say "whoa" and tell others. Drives word of mouth and initial sharing. Can be strong even if retention is low.
- **Recurring Value**: The reason users come back repeatedly. Drives retention. Can be strong even if first impression is underwhelming.

| | Strong Wow | Weak Wow |
|--|-----------|----------|
| **Strong Recurring** | Best case. Viral + retained. | Users stay but don't spread. Fix onboarding/first experience. |
| **Weak Recurring** | Users share but don't return. Fix core value loop. | Nothing works. Rethink product. |

**Current product diagnosis:**
- Wow Factor: <!-- strong / moderate / weak -->
- Recurring Value: <!-- strong / moderate / weak -->

### Viral / Referral Loop Design

**Viral types (pick which applies):**
- [ ] **Inherent Viral**: Using the product naturally exposes others (e.g., sending money via Toss exposes recipient to Toss)
- [ ] **Referral Program**: Incentivized invite ("invite a friend, both get X")
- [ ] **Word of Mouth**: Organic sharing, not trackable

**If Referral exists, design the loop:**
```
User discovers value → Prompted to invite → Friend receives invite → Friend signs up → Friend discovers value → ...
```

**Viral K = Payload × Frequency × Conversion Rate**
- Payload: how many people see each invite?
- Frequency: how often does the same person see it?
- Conversion Rate: what % of recipients sign up?

| Component | Current | Target | How to Improve |
|-----------|---------|--------|---------------|
| Payload | | | |
| Frequency | | | |
| Conversion | | | |

**Amplification Factor = 1 ÷ (1 - Viral K)**
- K=0.2 → AF=1.25 (every paid user is worth 1.25 users)
- K=0.4 → AF=1.67
- K=0.5 → AF=2.0 (can bid 2x on ads vs competitors)

## Channels

| Channel | Priority | Effort | Expected Impact | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|----------------|--------|
| Build in Public (X/Twitter) | High | Daily 30min | Brand + early users | |
| Product Hunt | High | One-time | Launch spike | |
| SEO / Blog | High | Weekly 2-3h | Long-term organic | |
| Referral program | High | One-time setup | Sustainable inflow | |
| Show HN | Medium | One-time | Developer audience | |
| Reddit | Medium | Weekly 1h | Community trust | |
| Email sequences | High | One-time setup | Retention + conversion | |

**Channel evaluation rule**: Track Cohort Retention per channel. A low-CAC channel that brings users who churn is worse than a high-CAC channel that brings users who stay.
